	The general goal of this mod is to create a niche for pipe rifles in the hobo phase, featuring adequate burst damage offset by inferior ammo economy.
	The intended performance of these guns is to be able to land a guaranteed kill on a single average enemy before needing to retreat in order to reload.

version 0.1

	1. 	"pipe rifle: XX" merged into "pipe rifle: slam fire" and changed item description, now takes various pistol caliber rounds. Removed mechanics requirement for crafting.
	2. 	"pipe rifle: pepperbox" added. 4-barrel variant of the pipe rifle, takes various pistol caliber rounds, reloads one barrel at a time, fires all barrels at the same time.
	3. 	"pipe rifle: double barrel" added. 2-barrel variant of the pipe rifle, takes various rifle caliber rounds, reloads one barrel at a time, fires both barrels at the same time.
	4. 	Merged all rifle caliber pipe rifles into the double barrel variant.
	5. 	Added a 10-round makeshift STANAG mag variant.
	6. 	Renamed both STANAG makeshift mags to fit with the rest of them.

version 0.2

	1. "slam fire: single shot" now has a 0.85x ranged damage modifier. Removed flat damage modifier. Accepts more ammo types.
	2. "slam fire: double barrel", now has 0.9x ranged damage modifier. Removed flat damage modifier.
	3. "slam fire: four-shot" now has 0.85x ranged damage modifier. Weight and volume increased. Accepts more pistol caliber ammo types.
	3. "slam fire: six-shot" added. 6 barrel variant of the pipe rifle, takes smallest pistol caliber rounds.
	4. "peppebox revolver rifle" added. 6 manually rotated barrels. Heavy and cumbersome, but comparable ballistic performance to factory guns.
	
		Dynamic range damage modifier added in order to reinforce the idea of pipe guns having inferior ammo economy, while still posessing adequate burst DPS.
		Flat damage modifiers removed as those are more appropriate for reflecting factory made firearms' minimal ballistic performance differences around a single caliber, and are unfit to use with a multi-caliber gun due to vast differences in bullet damage.
		Offset by the ability to accept almost all common calibers divided between the double barrel and the pepperbox.
		
		Intended performance is not affected in practicality, the nerf solely affects ammo economy.

	Outstanding issues:
		>Caliber assignment will need rebalancing.
		>Weight and volume are more or less arbitrary at the moment.
		>Same variant rifles loaded different calibers stack for some reason.
		>Weapons do not update their weight when reloaded, vanilla issue.
		>ASCII art and icons havent been touched.
		>Caliber conversion kits throw up inconsequential errors on loading.
		>UI displays ids instead of item names when examining a conversion kit.
